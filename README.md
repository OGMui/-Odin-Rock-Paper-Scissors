# Odin-Rock-Paper-Scissors

## Overview

This repository represents my implementation of the "Rock Paper Scissors" game. This assignment is the first JavaScript program for The Odin Project Foundations Course.

The assignment tasks me with creating the classic "Rock Paper Scissors" game to be played in the browser console. Subsequently, we'll enhance the project by adding a graphical user interface as we progress through the course.
