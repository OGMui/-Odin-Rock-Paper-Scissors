# Odin-Rock-Paper-Scissors

## Overview

This repository represents my implementation of the "Rock Paper Scissors" game. This assignment is the first JavaScript program for The Odin Project Foundations Course.

The initial assignment tasked me with creating the classic "Rock Paper Scissors" game to be played in the browser console. Subsequently, an assignment was provided to add a basic user interface (UI).

The game is playable through the provided UI, allowing players to make selections by clicking on buttons instead of typing their answers. Results are displayed on the screen, along with the running score and the winner of the game once one player reaches five points.

## Play the Game

You can play the game by clicking on the following link: [Rock Paper Scissors Game](https://ogmui.github.io/odin-rock-paper-scissors/) 

## Future improvements

While the current version provides a user interface, it is very basic without any CSS styling, I plan to make the improvements by adding custom buttons and generally improving the user experience.
